# NIDS_Metric
This is a repository for R code which allows researchers to calculate the NIDS Metric (Number of Isotopically Distinct Specimens) using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values from bone collagen following the publication by Hyland et al. 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-021-09533-7).
The code is currently set up to run data that is entered following the format of the csv file "Book1.csv", which allows for data to be entered as d13C and d15N values only.
I will work to update the code so that the d13C and d15N values can be specified within a larger dataset so contextual information about each sample can be included in these analyses.
